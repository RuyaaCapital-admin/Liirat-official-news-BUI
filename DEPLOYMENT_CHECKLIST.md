  "outputDirectory": "dist/spa",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/((?!api).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables Required
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` - Auto-set by Vercel

## 📁 Files Added/Modified

### New Files ✅
- `client/pages/AITradingAssistant.tsx` - Main AI trading page
- `client/components/ui/ai-trading-nav.tsx` - Navigation component
- `server/routes/ai-trading.ts` - Backend API routes
- `AI_TRADING_ASSISTANT.md` - Documentation
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - This file

### Modified Files ✅
- `client/App.tsx` - Added AI trading route
- `client/pages/Index.tsx` - Added AI trading navigation
- `server/index.ts` - Added AI trading API routes
- `package.json` - Added new dependencies
- `.env.example` - Updated with AI trading variables

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Add: OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key
# 3. Set to Production environment
```

### 2. Deploy Command
```bash
# Vercel will automatically:
# 1. Install dependencies: npm install
# 2. Build: npm run build:client
# 3. Deploy to CDN
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Main page loads correctly
- [ ] AI Trading Assistant page accessible at `/ai-trading`
- [ ] Navigation button works
- [ ] TradingView chart loads
- [ ] AI chat functionality works (with API key)
- [ ] Market data displays
- [ ] News feed shows

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Build Fails with "News is not exported"**
- ✅ FIXED: Changed `News` to `Newspaper` in lucide-react imports

**Build Fails with "Duplicate key autosize"**
- ✅ FIXED: Removed duplicate `autosize: true` in TradingView config

**AI Chat Not Working**
- Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables
- Verify API key has sufficient credits
- Check network tab for API errors

**TradingView Chart Not Loading**
- Ensure no ad blockers are active
- Check if TradingView is accessible from deployment region
- Verify internet connection

**Market Data Not Updating**
- Currently using mock data
- For real data, add market API keys to environment variables

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size
- Current bundle: ~567KB (acceptable for production)
- Consider code splitting for future optimization
- TradingView widget loads asynchronously

### API Rate Limits
- OpenAI API has rate limits
- Consider implementing request caching
- Monitor API usage in production

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets cached by Vercel CDN
- API responses can be cached for market data
- News data cached for 5-10 minutes

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements ✅
- [x] AI chat interface works
- [x] TradingView chart loads
- [x] Market data displays
- [x] News feed shows
- [x] Navigation works
- [x] Responsive design

### Performance Requirements ✅
- [x] Build completes successfully
